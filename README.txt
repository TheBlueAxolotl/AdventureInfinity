All about this mod so far:
First, in the overworld, there are snakes. They don't do much except look derpy. And then there's the first new ore, Tanzanite. Found deep in the overworld, this gemstone is based on the blue or violet gemstone mostly found in east Asia. Covering this tanzanite with obsidian on a crafting table gives it the power to teleport players into their dreams. In this new dream dimension, you'll have to dig far into the crust, dodging the monsters until you find the legendary gemstone known only as Maginite. Use this Maginite to make a powerful sword, but that's not it, combine this new sword with a tanzanite gem to create a Tanzanite Infused Sword. Conquer the world with this brand new legendary weapon!
